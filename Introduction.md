# Introduction #

Negroni is a framework for creating fast and efficient control structures based on XML documents.  Included in the Negroni package is an implementation of an OpenSocial gadget parser/renderer.  This can be used to add OpenSocial gadget support to your site, or you can use the core Negroni framework to compose your own parsers.


# Using Negroni #

These documents are tuned to help you to either use Negroni out of the box or as a framework for your own control parsers.
